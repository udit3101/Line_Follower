# Line Follower Code using LRS, LSR, RLS Algorithms
This repository contains the source code for a line follower robot using LRS (Left, Right, Stop), LSR (Left, Straight, Right), and RLS (Right, Left, Stop) algorithms. The code is intended to be used with a robot that follows a line on the ground using sensors and executes specific actions based on the detected line position.

# Algorithms Used
# LRS (Left, Right, Stop) Algorithm
In this algorithm, the robot will turn left if it detects the line on the left, turn right if it detects the line on the right, and stop if it detects no line.

# LSR (Left, Straight, Right) Algorithm
This algorithm instructs the robot to turn left if it detects the line on the left, move straight if it detects the line in the center, and turn right if it detects the line on the right.

# RLS (Right, Left, Stop) Algorithm
In this algorithm, the robot will turn right if it detects the line on the right, turn left if it detects the line on the left, and stop if it detects no line.

# Getting Started
